# Get Started

To get started, you need two things:

1. A Stablecog account
2. A Stablecog API key

Visit [stablecog.com](https://stablecog.com) to create an account. Then you can visit your [account page](https://stablecog.com/account/api-keys) to create an API key.

<Button class='mt-3 mb-2' href='https://stablecog.com/account/api-keys' target="_blank">
Create API Key
</Button>

If you have both of these ready, you can start generating images, upscaling images, and anything else our platform offers.
