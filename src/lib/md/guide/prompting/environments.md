# Environments

You can put your subjects in different environments to set the mood of the image. Describing an environment will affect the image in different ways such as different colors and lighting. For example, a desert natural has a warmer color palette with harsher lighting while a snowy environment naturally has a colder color palette with softer lighting.

You can still tweak these environments to your liking. The environment you describe doesn't even need to exist in the real world. However, selecting a simple environment is a good way to get started.

## Environment Examples

The examples below are made with [Kandinsky v2.1](/guide/models/kandinsky).
