[Stable Diffusion 3](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3-medium) is an open-source diffusion model, the long waited upgrade to [SDXL](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-sdxl-1-announcement). It is created by [Stability AI](https://stability.ai). It's significantly better than previous Stable Diffusion models at incorporating text into images. It can create images in variety of aspect ratios without any problems.

Considering its roots, it is expected to become the new default for creating fine-tuned models. The model focuses on being versatile for creating images in wide variety of styles and letting people fine-tune the model easily according to their asthetic preferences.
