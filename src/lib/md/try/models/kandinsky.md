# Try Kandinsky v2.1 for Free

[Kandinsky v2.1](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2) is an open-source and multilingual latent diffusion model. It is created by a [group of researchers](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2#authors) from Russia. It's not based on Stable Diffusion, it's an original model. It's very good at different aspect ratios and resolutions. It doesn't seem to have the "doubling" problem some Stable Diffusion models have. It also produces artistic results without the need for long prompts.

It is often called the open-source [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com). It indeed reminds us of Midjourney as well. It can create amazingly artistic images with short prompts but it's not limited to a small set of styles as opposed to some other models. It's also good at realistic images.
